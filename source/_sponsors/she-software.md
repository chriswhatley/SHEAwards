** We apply technology to solve our customers’ health and safety challenges. **
 
For more than 20 years, we’ve been developing health and safety management software. Founded in Scotland in 1995, we now serve over 250 customers across different business sectors. With our head office based in Glasgow, we also have offices across the UK, in the US and New Zealand - so we truly are a global team. 

From day one, we’ve tried to make the most of emerging technology and do things a little bit differently. Back in the mid-90s it was the concept of online. These days it’s the market-leading latest in health and safety Business Intelligence (BI) tools.
