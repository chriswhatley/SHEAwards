** For more than 20 years, SHE Software has been developing health and safety management software. **	

Founded in Scotland in 1995, it now serves over 250 customers across different business sectors. With its head office based in Glasgow, SHE Software also have offices across the UK, in the US and New Zealand.

From day one, SHE Software says it tried to make the most of emerging technology and do things a little bit differently. Back in the mid-90s it was the concept of online. These days it’s the market-leading latest in health and safety Business Intelligence (BI) tools.

But its real power lies beyond the technical. It’s a commitment to solving customers’ health and safety challenges that sets SHE Software apart. It takes a full-circle approach, collaborating with customers at each step of their health and safety journey – from the initial identification of business requirements, getting to know them and their business, implementing a tailored plan and working closely with them long term to help realise their health and safety ambitions.

Its team of technology experts are IOSH or NEBOSH (sometimes both) qualified and talk to thousands of health and safety professionals every year, which means they have an incredible overview of the challenges facing industry professionals around the world. They bring all of that insight to developing our Assure, health and safety software solution.
