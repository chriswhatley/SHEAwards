There's so much we could say when we are asked about our company - but let's keep things simple. We are a science-based technology company that is committed to improving lives and doing business in the right way - which is why we have been listed as a World's Most Ethical Company for three years in succession. And we love applying our science to creating products that, in big ways and small, make things better in some way. Helping people to be safe. Making them more productive. Protecting their health. Safeguarding the environment. And we have an insatiable appetite for meeting the world's ever-changing challenges. 

We are relentless in our pursuit of solutions to our customers' problems - one third of our revenues come from products that didn't exist five years ago. At 3M, honesty, integrity and the ability to work as part of a team contribute to a culture that is founded on curiosity, problem-solving and collaboration. 

We work tirelessly to deliver our vision: 3M technology advancing every company. 3M products enhancing every home. 3M innovation improving every life.
